  <div>
    <p>I am a researcher in reinforcement learning and musculoskeletal control, as well as a licensed Korean medicine doctor.</p>

    <p>My research focuses on applying reinforcement learning to the control of musculoskeletal models and using physics-based simulation to better understand human movement. I am particularly interested in how models learned through physics-based simulation can help interpret movement dysfunction and support clinical decision-making.</p>
