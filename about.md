## About Me

I am a researcher in reinforcement learning and musculoskeletal control, as well as a licensed Korean medicine doctor.

My research focuses on applying reinforcement learning to the control of musculoskeletal models and using physics-based simulation to better understand human movement. I am particularly interested in how models learned through physics-based simulation can help interpret movement dysfunction and support clinical decision-making.

Through this work, I aim to bridge advances in AI and computational modeling with practical knowledge from clinical practice.


### Research Interests

- Reinforcement learning for biomechanical systems 
- Musculoskeletal modeling and control   
- Physics-based simulation of human movement
